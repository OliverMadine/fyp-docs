\section{Introduction} % 1.5 pages

% 1. Why fuzzing for parsers is important?

Parsers are critical components of many software systems with compilers being a stand out example. Issues in these systems can be devastating; recently, a bug in the Vyper compiler caused a security vulnerability for Curve Finance, reportedly costing up to \$62 million \cite{curve}. Extensive testing of parsing libraries is therefore vital to both support overall correctness of these systems and establish user trust. Traditional software testing methods, however, can be expensive, accounting for up to 50\% of development costs \cite{quickcheck}.

In this project, we explore how we can improve the correctness of parsers by presenting several fuzzing techniques in the unique context of parser combinators libraries. Using Gigaparsec as our target library, we primarily focus our attention on metamorphic testing by building on the work of \cite{staged-selective} to discover and test new parser combinator laws in practice.

% - symbolic: path explosion

% 4. Previous work on X has addressed these with Y, but the problems with this are Z.
parser directed fuzzing + Constraint-based test generation + left recursion address these challenged but limitations

% 5) This has the following appealing properties and our experiments show this and that.
We hypothesize that Gigapasec bugs found through our randomized testing will have a high likelihood of being relevant in practice as seems to be the case for compiler fuzzing \cite{fuzzing-importance}. It could be argued that many bugs discovered in this project are niche cases and unlikely to be found in practice. A formal evaluation of the significance of any bugs discovered is left to future work.

Parser Combinator libraries are an increasingly popular method of writing parsers by treating parsers as first class values to form larger parsers by
combining smaller parsers.
