\section{Introduction}

% 1. Why parsers are important? (cite curve)
Parsers are a critical component of many software systems, including compiler
Testing accounts for 50\% of software development cost (cite quickCheck)
\\

% 2. In this work we do W (?).
In this project, we explore how we can improve the robustness of parsers by presenting several
fuzzing techniques in the unique context of parser combinators libraries. We use Gigaparsec as
our target library. It could be argued that many bugs discovered in this project are niche cases
and unlikely to be found in practice. A formal evaluation of the significance of any bugs discovered
is left to future work. We primarily focus our attention on metamorphic testing by building on the 
work of (cite selective parser combinators) to discover and test new parser combinator laws in
practice.

% 3. interesting / challenges
left-recursion, corresponding inputs / coverage
\\

% 4. Previous work on X has addressed these with Y, but the problems with this are Z.
parser directed fuzzing + Constraint-based test generation + left recursion address these challenged but limitations
\\

% 5) This has the following appealing properties and our experiments show this and that.
We hypothesize that Gigapasec bugs found through our randomized testing will have a high likelihood of being relevant in practice as seems to be true for compiler fuzzing (cite importance).

\section{Background}
% TODO: google what goes in a background section?
% gigaparsec
% parsec
% fuzzing
% metamorphic testing
% differential testing
% parser combinators
Parser Combinator libraries are an increasingly popular method of writing parsers by treating parsers as first class values to form larger parsers by
combining smaller parsers.
% parser combinators laws
% quickcheck
% quickspec
% parsley

\section{Evaluation plan}
% old bugs
% coverage
% new bugs
% bug triggered by real world parsers? (e.g. test if jamies wacc implementation hits it)
