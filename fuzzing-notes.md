# Fuzzing

## QuickCheck Paper
- Fuzzing is most effective when the distribution of random test data matches the actual data.
- If not known we can use uniform. For infinite sets, this is does not make sense.

## Questions
- Is our actual data distribution completely unknown or do we have some constraints?
